# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to both determine which employees were retiring per title and which employees were eligible for entering a mentorship program. By relating multiple tables in our database, we were able to query various data tables and create unified views that revealed this information.

## Results
The combined data was very insightful. A few things that relating the data was able to reveal was:
- There were 90,398 retiring employees, a majority (~64%) of which held senior positions.
- The largest volume of retiring employees were senior engineers, with 29,414 retirees.
- The smallest volume of retiring employees were managers, with 2 retirees.
- There are 1,549 employees eligible for the mentorship program.

## Summary
The analysis gives a lot of insight about trends in Pewlett Hackard's demographic shifts. They will shortly need to fill 90,398 roles (of which about 64% of are senior-level position) due to anticipated retirements. However, there are only 1,549 employees that are able to participate in the mentorship program. That would mean each mentor would need to teach about 58 employees to fill this talent void. The data shows that there are currently lacking enough qualified individuals to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard's employees. 

Would there be other individuals capable of helping those initial eligible to mentor? Using the query below, we can see that there is a large population of senior staff members under the age of 60:

Pewlett Hackard has a large talent pool of experts that are still decently far out from retiring. If they were to expand their mentorship program criteria, they would be able to alleviate the burden of the initial 1,549 eligible mentors.

Looking at the query below, Pewlett Hackard doesn't have any employees born after 1965. With the addition of more mentors as discussed above, they should also focus on hiring a lot of young talent to fill the void soon to be left by those retiring.
